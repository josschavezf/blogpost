With bachelor formation as Engineer in Biotechnology by the National Polytechnic Institute from Mexico ([IPN](http://www.upiig.ipn.mx)), I started my scientific career studying Plant Epigenetics in [CINVESTAV](http://www.ira.cinvestav.mx), then I obtained a master degree by the Biotechnology [Institute](http://www.ibt.unam.mx) from the National Autonomous University of Mexico ([UNAM](http://www.unam.mx)) developing a project focused on _Drosophila_ epigenetics. 

As a current P.hD. Student in Merino's [Lab](https://biocomputo.ibt.unam.mx) I am developing a bioinformatics project focused on the analysis of transcriptional regulators in bacteria. I am interested in the evolutionary origin of transcriptional regulatory networks that leads to gene regulation as we known today. 

I have used [R](https://www.r-project.org) programming language during the last 4 years and since 2018 started to develop my own packages.
